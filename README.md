üßÆ Low-Risk Portfolio Optimization Project (2019‚Äì2020 Market Shock Analysis)
üìö Overview

This project evaluates risk-managed portfolio strategies across the 2019‚Äì2020 period, with a special focus on how portfolios perform during market disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary goal is to minimize Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) using daily return data from 100 Nasdaq-100 stocks.

We explore various risk models using historical returns, test their out-of-sample performance, and evaluate portfolio stability and adaptability over time. The analysis covers both annual and rolling monthly re-optimization techniques.

üîÅ IMPORTANT: All code is written to dynamically adapt to any correctly-formatted dataset. Make sure your CSV file matches the required input format. You can swap in new data by changing the CSV in the pd.read_csv() line.
